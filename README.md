# CSS Box Model

CSS treats every HTML elements as a box. The CSS box model helps you understand and control how to prsent HTML elements with CSS.

Everything displayed by CSS is a box.

The size and behavior of the boxes will be based on their display values, dimensions and the content within them.

# Intrinsic and Extrinsic Sizing

Intrinsic sizing allows the browsers to control the boxes based on the content of the box while extrinsic sizing gives instructions for the styling/sizing of everything inside the element.

If a box is styled with extrinsic sizing and the content of the box is larger than the box, it will result in an overflow of the content out of the box.
